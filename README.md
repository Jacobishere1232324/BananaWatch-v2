Antivirus & Safety Information

Some antivirus programs may detect BananaWatch v2 or its injector as a false positive. This occurs because the software uses injection and memory interaction techniques that are commonly associated with malware behavior, even when the program itself is not malicious.

BananaWatch v2 does not collect personal data, log keystrokes, or run hidden background processes. Temporarily disabling antivirus protection prevents false detections or file removal. Users should re-enable antivirus protection after use.
